# Send to GoodLinks Extension

This is a Chrome extension that allows you to quickly send links to the [GoodLinks](https://goodlinks.app) app on macOS.

It was developed using the [GoodLinks URL Scheme](https://goodlinks.app/url-scheme/). Whenever
you click the extension icon, the current tab URL is sent to GoodLinks. No iCloud integration
or API setup are needed.
